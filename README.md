# Tetradd
Tetris with math 
GOALS
1. enable tetris-like freefall while still being able to control 
   2. done but very laggy? code might need rework
2. need to set up equations that trigger the start of the free fall.
3. spawn new objects after it falls to the bottom 
4. have objects stack  on each other rather than fall through the screen
